# declare an int variable named total with the value of 0

# declare an array named numbers with all numbers 0 - 20

# write a for loop that processes each number
# if the number is even add it to total
# if the number is odd and a multiple of 5 display the number preceded by the word Checkpoint: on a single line

#display the value of total followed by a dash and the word total

total = 0

numbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 , 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]

count = 0

blarp = 21

if  blarp > count
    value = numbers[count]
    count += 1
    if 0 == value % 2
       total += value
    else
        if value % 5 == 0
        print "Checkpoint %d" % value
