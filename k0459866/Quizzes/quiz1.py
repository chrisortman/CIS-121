# Please complete this quiz
#

# declare an int variable named total with the value of 0
x = 0
# declare an array (list) named numbers with all numbers 0 - 20
numbers = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20]

# write a for loop that processes each number
for nums in numbers:
    print nums
# if the number is even add it to total
    if nums % 2 == 0:
        total = (nums + 0)(nums + 0)
# if the number is odd and a multiple of 5 display the number preceded by the word Checkpoint: on a single line
    if nums % 2 != x and nums % 5 == x:
        print "Checkpoint"
#display the value of total followed by a dash and the word total
print total,"- total"
